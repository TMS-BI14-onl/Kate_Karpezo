Well done!

Wow, what a solution! :)))
It would be better though to splve it with multiple simple merges, like:
MERGE INTO res t
USING data_for_merge s ON s.Barbara=t.function_name
WHEN MATCHED 
	THEN UPDATE SET function_count=function_count+1
WHEN NOT MATCHED AND Barbara IS NOT NULL
	THEN INSERT (function_name, function_count)
	VALUES (Barbara, 1);

We don't need a subquery to add age category - all can be done in one query.
